/**
 * This class captures a limited history of an aircraft's position and velocity.  
 * This class essentially operates as an array, where the time field determines
 * the order.  It is intended that this method is called frequently and the 
 * oldest values are dropped.  The maximum number of values stored is available
 * through maxBufferSize().  The oldest value (that is, the smallest t) is always 
 * in element 0, the latest element (that is, the largest time) is always at index
 * size() - 1.<p>
 *
 * The primary accessors are position() and velocity() which are indexed from 0 to size()-1.
 * The latest values are located at size()-1.<p>
 * 
 * The method get() will return a Euclidean projection of the position and
 * velocity given the projection function in setProjection() or updateProjection().  Be careful:
 * if you do not specifically indicate which projection to use, this class will make
 * a choice for you, that is probably not what you expect.<p>
 * 
 * In addition, this method can predict future points (currently this uses a quadratic 
 * regression approximation).  These predictions are available through the methods pred(t), and predLinear(t).
 * These are based on the Euclidean projected points.
