/**
 * Objects of class "BandsCore" compute the conflict prevention bands
 * using linear state-based predictions of ownship and (multiple)
 * traffic aircraft positions.  This class presumes the use "internal" units
 * and Cartesian coordinates and it doesn't perform bookkeeping of its parameters.
 * For instance, if D, H, etc are set after traffic has been added, the method
 * clear() has to be explicitly called. Otherwise, the state of the bands object
 * is undetermined.  For all these reasons, this class is not intended for 
 * general use. It is most appropriate for building algorithms that include 
 * prevention band information. For a more "user-friendly" version, try the Bands class. <p>
 *
 * The bands consist of ranges of guidance maneuvers: track angles,
 * ground speeds, and vertical speeds. If a path is (immediately)
 * taken that is within one these bands and no traffic aircraft
 * maneuvers, then a loss of separation will occur within the
 * specified lookahead time.  Implicitly, any path that is not in a
 * band does not have a loss of separation within the lookahead
 * time.<p>
 *
 * Disclaimers: Only parts of these algorithms have been formally
 * verified.  We plan to advance the formal verification, but it is
 * currently not complete. Even with a 'complete' verification, there
 * will still be certain assumptions.  For instance, the formal proofs
 * use real numbers while these implementations use floating point
 * numbers, so numerical differences could result. In addition, the
 * geodesic computations include certain inaccuracies, especially near
 * the poles.<p>
 *
 *
 * The basic usages is
 * <pre>
 * Bands b(..with configuration parameters..);
 * b.clear();
 * b.addTraffic(relative position of ownship and traffic,
 *              velocity of ownship, 
 *              velocity of one traffic aircraft);
 * b.addTraffic(relative position of ownship and traffic,
 *              velocity of ownship, 
 *              velocity of one traffic aircraft);
 * ...add other traffic aircraft...
 * 
 * IntervalSet track_bands = b.trackBands();
 * IntervalSet ground_speed_bands = b.groundSpeedBands();
 * IntervalSet vertical_speed_bands = b.verticalSpeedBands();
 * </pre>
 *
 * When any "parameter" to this class is set (lookahead time, etc.),
 * any previous bands information is cleared; therefore, all traffic
 * aircraft must be added <em>after</em> the parameters are
 * configured.
