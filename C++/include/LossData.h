 *
 * [CAM] (time_in,time_out) is the time interval of loss of separation. Every point in the open interval represents
 * a time where the aircraft are in violation. Whether or not the bounds of the interval are violation points or not
 * depends on the detector, e.g., for CD3D the points time_in and time_out are not necessarily violations points,
 * for WCV_tvar the points time_in and time_out violation times. Furthermore, time_in and time_out are always
 * between the lookahead time interval [B,T], where 0 <= B < T. It is always the case that if time_in < time_out
 * is true, then there is a conflict.
