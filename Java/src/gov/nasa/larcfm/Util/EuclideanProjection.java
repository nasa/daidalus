/**
 * This is an interface for local Euclidean projections around a given point.  This projection may be used to
 * transform geodesic coordinates (LatLonAlt objects) into this Euclidean frame, using the project() method.  Also points
 * within this frame, may be found in geodesic coordinates with the inverse() method.   As long as the points are
 * close to the projection point, the errors should be very small.
 * 
 * Euclidean positions will be with respect to a projection point (this becomes the origin of the new Euclidean space).
 * Note that this will often alter relative position altitude information as well!  If this is not desired, the projection should 
 * be made against a zero-altitude point.
 * 
 * EuclideanProjection objects should never be created directly.  Instead they should be retrieved via the Projection.createProjection()
 * method.
 * 
 * Also please note that, in order to retain expected behaviors (such as projected collisions), it is often necessary to 
 * project velocities as well as positions. This is especially the case as you move further from the projection point.  
 * These velocities may change in both track and ground speed components through the projection.
