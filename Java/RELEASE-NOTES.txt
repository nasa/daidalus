Release DAIDALUS-v2.0.g 
------------------
June 8, 2020

* DTA logic is fully implemented. When DTA lat,lon, radius, and height
   is provided, DAIDALUS automatically uses dta_alerter accordingly
   to either ownship or intruder centric alerting. When DTA is active,
   special bands are computed when an alert higher than corrective,
   i.e., warning, is issued. The behavior of the special bands is
   controlled by the dta_logic value. When the value is positive,
   vertical bands block the down side. When the value is negative,
   vertical bands block the down side and horizontal direction bands
   saturate. When the value of dta is zero, DTA logic is disabled.
* DTA can be manually activated by setting the DTA alerter of the
  ownship, when ownship-centric alerting logic, or intruder, when
  intruder-centric alerting logic, to dta_alerter.
  
* Winds in v2.0.g are sticky. Once they are set they remain set until
  explicitly set to a different value or the are disable using the
  method setNoWind() in the Daidalus class.

* Conflict bands, the ones in front of an aircraft, are computed until
  lookahead time. In some encounter, this will provide wider bands.

* When hysteresis is enabled, e.g., after the first alert of a given
  level, the subsequent alerts and maneuver guidance for the same
  alerting aircraft are computed using early alerting time instead of
  alerting time. Therefore, when ownship implements the resolutions
  bands are still accurate even if the conflict moved beyond the
  alerting time.

Release DAIDALUS-v2.0.f:
------------------
April 3, 2020

* Fixed bug in DaidalusRealBands, where boolean check
"if (saturated)" should have been "if (recovery)".
* Fixed resolution and preferred direction persistence logic.

February 27, 2020

* Implemented hysteresis logic (M of N and persistence) for maneuver
  guidance. Bands persistance was experimentally implemented in v2d.
  The implementation is v2f is different and more consistent with
  alerting persistence.

* Setting configuration parameters in a Daidalus object resets hysteresis. 

* The method clean() in the class Daidalus resets hysteresis. In older
versions of DAIDALUS, the method clean() was needed before adding the
ownship. This is not needed anymore.

* When SUM parameters are set to 0, the WCV_TAUMOD_SUM detector is
equivalent to the WCV_TAUMOD detector. In previous versions, a 10% of
value step error was always added to WCV_TAUMOD_SUM. However, if SUM
is not required, it's recommended that the WCV_TAUMOD detector is
used since WCV_TAUMOD_SUM will add a bit of computation overhead.

* Eliminated CD3Table to avoid overhead.

* In C++: Daidalus(Detection3D,double,double) constructor changed to
Daidalus(Detection3D*,double,double) for efficiency reasons. This
should only affect specialized users of DAIDALUS that use a
programatic configuration.

* In C++: The following static methods are now available
CDCylinder::CD3DCylinder()
WCV_TAUMOD::DO_365_DWC_Phase_I()
The return structures that are safe for referencing with "&" operator

Release DAIDALUS-v2.0.e:
------------------
February 15, 2020
* Corrected bug in C++, where reserve was used instead of resize. This
caused a segmentation fault in Visual Studio C++
* Reorganized examples in directory outside src
* Updated Makefile

May 19, 2019
* Fixed issue with intervals of length 0 (i.e, only one point). These
intervals are now removed from the computations.
* Fixed issue with getTimeIn and getTimeOut, where in case of
no-conflict, their return value is undefined. These methods are now guarded
by conflit predicated. In case of no conflict they return infinite
values.
* Fixed issue in WCV_TAUMOD_SUM, where violationSUMAt and detectionSUM
return inconsistent values when aircraft are at the border of the 
violation area.
* Better use of cache information in DaidalusCore. Alerting doesn't
trigger re-computation of banding core information.

Release DAIDALUS-v2.0.2d:
------------------
April 4, 2019

* Added hysteresis and persistence times
* Added preferred resolution persistence
* Added bands persistence
* Added alerting M of N

* Changed max_delta_resolution_xxx to persistence_preferred_xxx. A
  preferred resolution persists while the diference between the the
  preferred resolution and the best resolution is less than this parameter.

* Method setHorizontalSpeedUncertainty is now called
setHorizontalVelocityUncertainty.

* Method setVerticalVelocityZScore is now called
setVerticalSpeedZScore.

* Method alerting in Daidalus is now deprecated. It has been renamed
alertLevel.

* setAboveBelowHorizontalSpeed in DaidalusBands refactored as 
setAboveRelativeHorizontalSpeed and setBelowRelativeHorizontalSpeed.
Similar changes for  setRelativeVerticalSpeedBands, and
setRelativeAltitudeBands.

* Added configurable parameters for relative bands.

* Added UNKOWN bands region in cases where relative bands are
  used.

* Added hysteresis to alerting, preferred direction, and
resolution. Configurable through new parameters.

Implemented ownship/intruder centric alerting logic. There is a new
boolean configuration parameter ownship_centric_alerting. By default,
ownship_centric_alerting is set to true.

Programmatically this parameter can be changed through the
methods:
* setAlertingLogic(boolean ownship_centric) 
* setOwnshipCentricAlertingLogic()
* setIntruderCentricAlertingLogic()
The value of the parameter is obtained by the method
isAlertingLogicOwnshipCentric().

When the logic is ownship centric, an alerter for all traffic
aircraft is set by using
* setAlerterIndex(0,alerter_idx).

When the logic is intruder centric, individual alerters for each 
traffic aircraft (ac_idx) is set by using
* setAlerterIndex(ac_idx, alerter_idx)

The methods minHorizontalSeparationAtRecovery and
minVerticalSeparationAtRecovery in RecoveryInformation are now called
recoveryHorizontalDistance and recoveryVerticalDistance.

Release DAIDALUS-v2.0.2b:
------------------
October 15, 2018

daa.set_WC_SC_228_MOPS--> daa. set_WC_DO_365
daa.set_Buffered_WC_SC_228_MOPS --> daa. set_Buffered_WC_DO_365

Daidalus.getMultiKinematicBands() --> disappeared: The Daidalus object
implements all the functionality of MultiKinematicBands().

The field Daidalus.parameters is not longer available. Daidalus itself
implements all the methods available in DaidalusParameters. Therefore,
something like daa.parameters.getLookaheadTime() is now written
daa.getLookahaedTime();

*VERY IMPORTANT* List of alerters is now 1-indexed. 0 means none, 1 means first
alerter, 2 means second alerter, etc. More precisely:

1. Alerters are 1-indexed, i.e., 1 is the index of first alerter
(e.g., Phase I), 2 is the index of second alerter (e.g., Phase 2), 3 is the index of third alerter, etc.

2. By default, Ownship is set to alerter 0 (meaning none)

3. By default, Traffic aircraft is set to alerter 1 

4. If Onwship's alerter is set to 0, then the logic is "intruder-centric" and each aircraft's alerter is used for each aircraft. This is the default behavior.

5. If Ownship's alerter is set to a value different from 0, then the logic is "ownship-centric" and this is the alerter that is used for every traffic aircraft.

Release DAIDALUS-v2.0.2a:
------------------
October 4, 2018

* DADIALUS-2 supports multiple alerting structures that can be
  dynamically applied per traffic aircraft.

* DAIDALUS-2 corrects several misnomers in DAIDALUS-1 (see below).

* The class AlertLevels is now called Alerter. If daa is an object of
the class Daidalus, a particular alerter for this aircraft
can be set using the method:
daa.setAlerter(ac_idx,arleter_idx);
or equivalently,
daa.setAlerter(ac_idx,alerter_id);

In these calls, ac_idx is the index of the aircraft in the traffic
list. The index 0 represents the ownship and the last index is the one
in daa.lastTrafficIndex().  Alerters are collected in a list indexed
from 0 (default alerter) to daa.parameters.numberOfAlerters()-1.


Configuration by File
----
To configure alerters using a file (same as in DAIDALUS-1):
daa.loadFromFile("configuration_file.txt");

DAIDALUS-2 correctly reads DAIDALUS-1 configuration
files. In this case, only 1 alerter is configured. The configuration
file for multiple alerters is done by configuring a list of alerter identifiers, e.g.,

alerters = Buffered_DWC_Phase_I,DWC_Phase_I

The order in this list is important, the index 0 corresponds to
Buffered_DWC_Phase_I and the index 1 corresponds to DWC_Phase_I. The
definition of these alerters is provided in the lines that follows
this line in the configuration file. Each one is similar to the
configuration of alert_levels in DAIDALUS-1.

The field conflict_level is replaced by a field corrective_region and
it takes a conflict region, e.g., FAR, MID, NEAR, instead of a
number. The reason for this change is that different alerters may
configure the corrective volume at a different alerting level. 

Programatic Configuration
----
It works as follows.

daa.parameters.clearAlerters(); // Remove all alerters
daa.parameters.addAlerter(Alerter. DWC_Phase_I()); // This put DWC_Phase_I alerter at the index 0
Alerter alerter1 = new Alerter(...);
... configuration of alerter 1 ...
daa.parameters.addAlerter(alerter1);
Aleter alertere2 = new Alerter(...);
... configuration of alerter 2...
daa.parameters.addAlerter(alerter2);
etc.

Misnomers
----------
* In the configuration file, the prefix, postfix "trk" is now "hdir"
and "gs" is now "hs". Furthermore, all of them are postfix, e.g.,
"trk_step" is now "step_hdir". However, DAIDALUS-2 still recognizes
the field names used in DAIDALUS-1.

* In the names of methods the prefix/postfix "Track" and "GroundSpeed"
  have been replaced by "HorizontalDirection" and "HorizontalSpeed",
  respectively. The reason for this change is that these methods may
  represent ground- or air- based values depending on whether a wind
  vector was configured.

* The method daa.setWindField(...) is now called
  daa.setWindVelocityTo(...). This clarifies that the "wind field" is
  just a vector and that the direction of the wind is "to". The method
  daa.setWindVelocityFrom(...) can be sued in case the wind vector is
  specified in the "from" direction.

Other Changes
------------
* The class KinematicMultiBands is now DaidalusBands 
* The class KinematicBands disappeared as its functionality is fully integrated
into DaidalusBands.
* The class KinematicBandsCore is now DaidalusBandsCore
* The class KinematicBandsParameters is now DaidalusParameters

In DaidalusBands (former KinematicMultiBands)
* track() -> HorizontalDirectionAt()
* groundSpeed() -> HorizontalSpeedAt() 
* verticalSpeed() -> VerticalSpeedAt() 
* altitude() -> altitudeAt()
* directionRangeOf -> indexOfHorizontalDirection
* trackLength -> horizontalDirectionBandsLength
* groundSpeedLength -> horizontalSpeedBandsLength
* verticalSpeedLength -> verticalSpeedBandsLength
* altitudeLength -> altitudeBandsLength
* timeIntervalOfViolation()->timeIntervalOfRegionViolation()
* horizontalSpeed-> horizontalSpeedIntervalAt
* horizontalSpeedRegion -> horizontalSpeedRegionAt
* horizontalSpeedRangeOf -> indexOfHorizontalSpeed
* peripheralDirectionAircraft(level): list<AircraftStates> ->
  peripheralHorizontalDirectionAircraft
* peripheralHorizontalSpeedAircraft(level): list<AircraftStates> ->
  peripheralHorizontalSpeedBandsAircraft(region):list<string>
* peripheralVerticalSpeedAircraft(level): list<AircraftStates> ->
  peripheralVerticalSpeedBandsAircraft(region):list<string>
* peripheralAltitudeAircraft(level): list<AircraftStates> ->
 peripheralAltitudeBandsAircraft(region):list<string>

In Daidalus:
* getAircraftState -> getAircraftStateAt
* timeToViolation -> timeToCorrectiveVolume

Gotchas:
* Spread bands will now compute UNKOWN bands, for ranges outside
   min/max values. 
* Check usage of method getUnits from DaidalusParameters as field
names  have changed, e.g., "trk_step" is now "step_hs".

Release DAIDALUS 1.0.2
------------------ 
April 21, 2019
* Fixed bug in the method toIntervalSet of the class
KinematicRealBands, where a range of length 0, i.e., a point, is
sometimes added to the list of bands due to numerical round-off
errors. This zero-length range may yield a
recovery bands that is slightly larger than necessary.
* Fixed bug in the method find_resolution of the class
KinematicRealBands, where a track resolution larger than 180 degrees
is sometimes returned. The fixed method will return either negative
infinity (left) or postive infinity (right) when no resolution exists
within 180 of the current track.

Release DAIDALUS 1.0.1
------------------
October 11, 2017
* Fixed bug in line 635 and 637 of Units.cpp. This bug only affects
MSVC++ (Thanks to Randal Guendel for reporting this issue).

March 18, 2017
* Added PVS specifications and proofs of core algorithms.
* Modified algorithm that projects aircraft trajectories. The
core detection, alerting, and bands algorithms use an Euclidean
three-dimensional coordinate system, i.e., a local East, North, Up
(ENU) Cartesian coordinate system. This coordinate system is based on
the orthogonal projection of the ownship and traffic geodesic
coordinates onto a plane tangent to the projected ownship position on
the surface of the earth. In previous releases, kinematic bands were
generated by projecting in time aircraft Geodesic states and then
projecting the resulting states into the Euclidean coordinate system.
In this release, Geodesic coordinates are projected into the Euclidean
coordinate system first, and then projected in time. This change
significantly improves the performance of the bands algorithm.
CAVEAT: Projected states may not be precise enough for a lookahead
time larger than 5 minutes.

* Modified behavior of detection, alerting, and bands algorithms with
respect to lookahead time. In the previous release, lookahead time was
expected to be larger than early alerting time, which was expected to
be larger than alerting time, for all alerting leves. In this release,
the time horizon for the core algorithms is between current time and
current time+lookahead time. In other words,  no violation, alert, or band is
computed after lookahead time (relative to current time).

* Modified algorithm that prints configuration parameters. In this
release, units from a configuration file are remembered and displayed
back when the configuration parameters are printed as a string or
saved into a file. Furthermore, configuration parameters are printed
in a better organized format.

* Fixed a bug that caused the region of a conflict band at 180 degrees
to be incorrectly computed as NONE. The bug was due to numerical error
where 180 degrees and -180 degrees were not considered to be equal.

Release DAIDALUS 1.0
------------------
November 18, 2016
* First non-alpha release of DAIDALUS. Parameters and thresholds have
  been configured according to DAA_MOPS_ToPMC_V3.8_2016-11-10.
* Used "almost equality" instead of "==" in guidance computation to
  mitigate numerical issues at the limits of the well-clear volume.
* Provided interface to non-hazard volume, which is defined using VMOD
  instead of TCOA.
* Fixed directional resolution logic for track, which in some cases
  returned maneuvers that were more than 180 degrees in one direction.

Release DAIDALUS 1.a2
------------------
September 26, 2016
* Fixed mismatch between tiovs_ and conflict_acs_ in
KinematicBandsCore. This error affected timeToViolation for a
given alert level.

September 23, 2016
* Fixed memory leaks in the AlertLevels class in C++.
* Changed default minimun ground speed to 10 [knots]. The previous value was 0,
which is not a valid ground speed. The minimum ground speed must be greater than
the ground speed step.
* Fixed a border case problem when detection was computed at exactly late alerting time. The
previous behavior always returned false in this case. The current behavior checks
if there is a violation at that unique position in time.
* Changed the behavior of track resolution, when the returned values is greater than 180.
In this release, the returned value is positive infinity, for the right resolution,
and negative infinity, for the left resolution.
* Fixed a problem in the characterization of regions in the case of recovery bands.
The previous behavior always returned either NEAR or RECOVERY regions, which is not
always correct. The current behavior returns the correct saturated region or RECOVERY.
Thanks to Randal Guendel (MIT/LL) for pointing this out.

Release DAIDALUS 1.a1, September 16, 2016  
---------------------
Fixed a bug in set_Buffered_WC_SC_228_MOPS(boolean type), where the
parameter type was ignored, and setKinematicBands(boolean type), where
turn_rate was set to 1/5, e.g., 0, instead of 1.5.

Release DAIDALUS 1.a0, September 11, 2016  
---------------------
Fixed a problem in the preparation of the C++ release.  Fixed a bug in
the setting of Min/Max gs,vs, and alt parameters in the method
setKinematicBandsParameters of the class KinematicMultiBands.

Release DAIDALUS 1.a, September 11, 2016  
---------------------
* Added methods set_WC_SC_228_MOPS() and
  set_Buffered_WC_SC_228_MOPS(boolean type) to Daidalus. 
  The method set_WC_SC_228_MOPS(), which is the default configuration
  of DAIDALUS, set the Daidalus object such that 
  - Alerting thresholds are unbuffered as defined by SC-228 MOPS.
  - Maneuver guidance logic assumes instantaneous maneuvers
  - Bands saturate at DMOD/ZTHR.
  The method set_Buffered_WC_SC_228_MOPS(boolean type) set the
  Daidalus object  such that 
  - Alerting thresholds are buffered 
  - Maneuver guidance logic assumes kinematic maneuvers
  - Turn rate is set to 3 deg/s, when type is true, and to  1.5 deg/s
     when type is false.
  - Bands don't saturate until NMAC
* Removed static field DefaultValues from KinematicBandsParameters.
* Renamed WC_SC_228() and Buffered_WC_SC_228() in AlertLevels as
  AlertLevelWC_SC_228_Thresholds() and
  Buffered_WC_SC_228_Thresholds(), respectively.
* Renamed late_alerting_time and set/getLateAlertingTime in
  AlertThresholds as  early_alerting_time and set/getEarlyAlertingTime.
  Original names were a misnomer.
* Fixed a bug in function rangeOf, where a value in the boundaries
  of a NEAR and MID bands returned the region UNKNOWN.
* Fixed a bug in preferred_direction, where an incorrect direction was
  returned when one of the directions was not feasible.
* Modified the logic of recovery bands for instantaneous maneuvers such that
   they are computed when the current state is in loss of well-clear.
* For efficiency reasons, the Daidalus method in Java 
   KinematicMultiBands getKinematicMultiBands()
   has the following signature in C++ 
   void kinematicMultiBands( KinematicMultiBand&) 
  To bring attention to this change, note the name change.
* Removed ConflictBands.cpp (C++). Bands.cpp includes this
  functionality.

Release DAIDALUS 0.99n, August 31, 2016  
---------------------
* Updated C++ code
* Redesigned resolution algorithms for compatibility with maneuver guidance
* Implemented preferred direction for each type of maneuver guidance
* Added parameters for horizontal_nmac and vertical_nmac 
* Pre-configured alert levels: 
 - WC_SC_228: Unbuffered threshold values (default)
 - Buffered_WC_SC_228: Buffered threshold values
 - Implemented instantaneous bands

Release DAIDALUS 0.99m, August 19, 2016  
---------------------
* The main change of this release is the implementation of multilevel
  bands. The function getKinematicBands is now called 
  getKinematicMultiBands and the return type is KinematicMultiBands
  instead of KinematicBands. By default, the guidance logic computes NEAR bands,
  which correspond to Warning alerts, MID bands, which correspond to
  Corrective alerts, RECOVERY bands, which correspond to well-clear
  recovery, and NONE bands, which indicate no predicted alert.

* The alerting and guidance logics are configurable through a new class
  called AlertLevels. This class includes a list of AlertThresolds and is
  ordered by alert level from less severe to more severe. Alert levels
  are 1-indexed. Alerting logic returns level of most severe set of
  alert thresholds that are violated, where level 0 indicates absence of alert.

* Configuration parameters, including alerting levels, can be read
  from a file. 

* Getting and setting of configuration parameters has also
  changed. Instead of providing setters and getters in the Daidalus
  and KinematicBandsParameters, these methods are provided through
  the public field parameters in the Daidalus and DefaultValues in 
  KinematicBandsParameters. For instance, the previous call 
  daa.getHorizontalAcceleration() is now available through 
  daa.parameters.getHorizontalAcceleration().
  Similarly, the previous call 
  DefaultDaidalusParameters.getHorizontalAcceleration()
  is now available through
  KinematicBandsParameters.DefaultValues.getHorizontalAcceleration().

* The constant VERSION is now defined in KinematicBandsParameters, e.g.,
   the call Daidalus.VERSION needs to be
   KinematicBandsParameters.VERSION. There is also a function
   Daidalus.release().

Release DAIDALUS 0.99b, February 10, 2016  
---------------------
* Added interface function for computing contours
* Added interface functions for computing last time to maneuver
* Added interface functions for computing resolution maneuvers in each
direction
* Removed bands-based alerting logic
 
Release DAIDALUS 0.99a, September 29, 2015  
---------------------
* Updated MOPS table in thresholds-based alerting to current values

Release DAIDALUS 0.99, September 26, 2015  
---------------------
* Removed unused configuration parameters, e.g. time_delay,
recovery_bands_iff_ca_bands, etc.
* Removed dependency in Daidalus from Plans. This change allows  for
a simpler interface to add aircraft states.
* Added PVS output for validation purposes
* Added C++ interface to DAIDALUS
* Added missing get and setter methods to DAIDALUS

Release DAIDALUS 0.9a, July 26, 2015  
---------------------
* Fixed the null pointer exception caused by time synchronization problem.
* Changed preventive thresholds so that they use "strict less" instead of "less or equal".
* Supplied new configuration file that only contains parameters relevant to CASSAT 2.

Release DAIDALUS 0.9, July 17, 2015
--------------------- 
Added configuration parameters to alerting logic to set preventive thresholds.

Release DAIDALUS 0.d, June 1, 2015
--------------------- 
Added interface to turn off/off recovery bands. 

Release DAIDALUS 0.c, April 23, 2015
--------------------- 
Minor configuration changes.

Release DAIDALUS 0.b, April 7, 2015
--------------------- 
Included an alerting algorithm that incorporates recommendations from
attendants of the 2-day UAS Workshop held at NASA Langley Research
Center on March 26-27, 2015.

Release DAIDALUS 0.a, March 17, 2015
---------------------
Initial release of DAIDALUS interface. References to Chorus and
Stratway+ objects have been removed. DAIDALUS only depends on Util and
ACCoRD.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.4, February, 2015
--------------------------------
* Decoupled lookahead time and alert time. This adds a new parameter for
alert time. It also adds the ability to specify a base configuration
file.

* Improved stability of well-clear bands by adding a time
stabilization parameter.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3b, January, 2015
-------------------------------
Added interface methods for setting independent lookahead times for
conflict and well-clear bands.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3a, January, 2015
-------------------------------
Added conflict detection logic to be used in conjunction with
prevention bands logic in PT5 experiment.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3, January, 2015
-------------------------------
* Added alerting logic and altitude bands interface to be used in PT5 experiment.

* Redesigned core architectural components of Stratway to support
integration of Well-Clear algorithms in the Appendix of RTCA SC 228
Detection and Avoid.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's well-clear alerting
concept.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's altitude bands concept.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's well-clear recovery bands. Current
implementation supports strategies for selecting most urgent aircraft
based on DCPA and Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA).

Release Stratway+ 1.8.4a, July, 2013
-------------------------------
* Modified interface to the TCAS prevention bands computed by Stratway+ to
enable different time and distance threshold tables for different aircraft.
* Initiated the development of prevention bands for flight levels. These
kinds of prevention bands indicate flight levels that are predicted to
be in conflict or cause a TCAS alert. In addition to aircraft state of
information (position and velocity vector information), the computation of
these bands require vertical acceleration and target rate of climb for the
ownship.

Release Stratway+ 1.8.3, April, 2013
-------------------------------
* Added table of time and distance thresholds for TCAS II Traffic
Alerts (TA).
* Added configurable TCAS II DMOD, TAU, ZTHR, and HMD threshold 
parameters.
* Added configurable on/off HMD filter for the TCAS II RA detection
logic.
* Added methods to access distance-based and TCAS-based conflict
information including most urgent conflict and for every conflict:
time to conflict, time out of conflict, and time of closest approach
(or time of minimum tau depending of configuration parameters).

February 21, 2013
--------------
Implemented a new interface to the TCAS-II RA detection code in
Stratway. The new interface will enable more sophisticated aircraft
kinematic models for predicting RAs and computing RA prevention bands.

December 5 2012
--------------
Developed a software interface in Stratway to support Langley's SSA
concept of integration. The software interface provides the following
functionality: creation of Stratway objects for ownship and traffic
aircraft, setting of configurable parameters such as time delays,
lookahead times, and maximum aircraft performance values, checking if
an aircraft is well-clear for TCAS-II RAs, and computing kinematics
prevention bands for conflict-free areas in the airspace.
