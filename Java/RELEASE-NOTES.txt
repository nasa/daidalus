Release DAIDALUS 1.0.1
------------------
October 11, 2017
* Fixed bug in line 635 and 637 of Units.cpp. This bug only affects
MSVC++ (Thanks to Randal Guendel for reporting this issue).

March 18, 2017
* Added PVS specifications and proofs of core algorithms.
* Modified algorithm that projects aircraft trajectories. The
core detection, alerting, and bands algorithms use an Euclidean
three-dimensional coordinate system, i.e., a local East, North, Up
(ENU) Cartesian coordinate system. This coordinate system is based on
the orthogonal projection of the ownship and traffic geodesic
coordinates onto a plane tangent to the projected ownship position on
the surface of the earth. In previous releases, kinematic bands were
generated by projecting in time aircraft Geodesic states and then
projecting the resulting states into the Euclidean coordinate system.
In this release, Geodesic coordinates are projected into the Euclidean
coordinate system first, and then projected in time. This change
significantly improves the performance of the bands algorithm.
CAVEAT: Projected states may not be precise enough for a lookahead
time larger than 5 minutes.

* Modified behavior of detection, alerting, and bands algorithms with
respect to lookahead time. In the previous release, lookahead time was
expected to be larger than early alerting time, which was expected to
be larger than alerting time, for all alerting leves. In this release,
the time horizon for the core algorithms is between current time and
current time+lookahead time. In other words,  no violation, alert, or band is
computed after lookahead time (relative to current time).

* Modified algorithm that prints configuration parameters. In this
release, units from a configuration file are remembered and displayed
back when the configuration parameters are printed as a string or
saved into a file. Furthermore, configuration parameters are printed
in a better organized format.

* Fixed a bug that caused the region of a conflict band at 180 degrees
to be incorrectly computed as NONE. The bug was due to numerical error
where 180 degrees and -180 degrees were not considered to be equal.

Release DAIDALUS 1.0
------------------
November 18, 2016
* First non-alpha release of DAIDALUS. Parameters and thresholds have
  been configured according to DAA_MOPS_ToPMC_V3.8_2016-11-10.
* Used "almost equality" instead of "==" in guidance computation to
  mitigate numerical issues at the limits of the well-clear volume.
* Provided interface to non-hazard volume, which is defined using VMOD
  instead of TCOA.
* Fixed directional resolution logic for track, which in some cases
  returned maneuvers that were more than 180 degrees in one direction.

Release DAIDALUS 1.a2
------------------
September 26, 2016
* Fixed mismatch between tiovs_ and conflict_acs_ in
KinematicBandsCore. This error affected timeToViolation for a
given alert level.

September 23, 2016
* Fixed memory leaks in the AlertLevels class in C++.
* Changed default minimun ground speed to 10 [knots]. The previous value was 0,
which is not a valid ground speed. The minimum ground speed must be greater than
the ground speed step.
* Fixed a border case problem when detection was computed at exactly late alerting time. The
previous behavior always returned false in this case. The current behavior checks
if there is a violation at that unique position in time.
* Changed the beahvior of track resolution, when the returned values is greater than 180.
In this release, the returned value is positive infinity, for the right resolution,
and negative infinity, for the left resolution.
* Fixed a problem in the characterization of regions in the case of recovery bands.
The previous behavior always returned either NEAR or RECOVERY regions, which is not
always correct. The current behavior returns the correct saturated region or RECOVERY.
Thanks to Randal Guendel (MIT/LL) for pointing this out.

Release DAIDALUS 1.a1, September 16, 2016  
---------------------
Fixed a bug in set_Buffered_WC_SC_228_MOPS(boolean type), where the
parameter type was ignored, and setKinematicBands(boolean type), where
turn_rate was set to 1/5, e.g., 0, instead of 1.5.

Release DAIDALUS 1.a0, September 11, 2016  
---------------------
Fixed a problem in the preparation of the C++ release.  Fixed a bug in
the setting of Min/Max gs,vs, and alt parameters in the method
setKinematicBandsParameters of the class KinematicMultiBands.

Release DAIDALUS 1.a, September 11, 2016  
---------------------
* Added methods set_WC_SC_228_MOPS() and
  set_Buffered_WC_SC_228_MOPS(boolean type) to Daidalus. 
  The method set_WC_SC_228_MOPS(), which is the default configuration
  of DAIDALUS, set the Daidalus object such that 
  - Alerting thresholds are unbuffered as defined by SC-228 MOPS.
  - Maneuver guidance logic assumes instantaneous maneuvers
  - Bands saturate at DMOD/ZTHR.
  The method set_Buffered_WC_SC_228_MOPS(boolean type) set the
  Daidalus object  such that 
  - Alerting thresholds are buffered 
  - Maneuver guidance logic assumes kinematic maneuvers
  - Turn rate is set to 3 deg/s, when type is true, and to  1.5 deg/s
     when type is false.
  - Bands don't saturate until NMAC
* Removed static field DefaultValues from KinematicBandsParameters.
* Renamed WC_SC_228() and Buffered_WC_SC_228() in AlertLevels as
  AlertLevelWC_SC_228_Thresholds() and
  Buffered_WC_SC_228_Thresholds(), respectively.
* Renamed late_alerting_time and set/getLateAlertingTime in
  AlertThresholds as  early_alerting_time and set/getEarlyAlertingTime.
  Original names were a misnomer.
* Fixed a bug in function rangeOf, where a value in the boundaries
  of a NEAR and MID bands returned the region UNKNOWN.
* Fixed a bug in preferred_direction, where an incorrect direction was
  returned when one of the directions was not feasible.
* Modified the logic of recovery bands for instantaneous maneuvers such that
   they are computed when the current state is in loss of well-clear.
* For efficiency reasons, the Daidalus method in Java 
   KinematicMultiBands getKinematicMultiBands()
   has the following signature in C++ 
   void kinematicMultiBands( KinematicMultiBand&) 
  To bring attention to this change, note the name change.
* Removed ConflictBands.cpp (C++). Bands.cpp includes this
  functionality.

Release DAIDALUS 0.99n, August 31, 2016  
---------------------
* Updated C++ code
* Redesigned resolution algorithms for compatibility with maneuver guidance
* Implemented preferred direction for each type of maneuver guidance
* Added parameters for horizontal_nmac and vertical_nmac 
* Pre-configured alert levels: 
 - WC_SC_228: Unbuffered threshold values (default)
 - Buffered_WC_SC_228: Buffered threshold values
 - Implemented instantaneous bands

Release DAIDALUS 0.99m, August 19, 2016  
---------------------
* The main change of this release is the implementation of multilevel
  bands. The function getKinematicBands is now called 
  getKinematicMultiBands and the return type is KinematicMultiBands
  instead of KinematicBands. By default, the guidance logic computes NEAR bands,
  which correspond to Warning alerts, MID bands, which correspond to
  Corrective alerts, RECOVERY bands, which correspond to well-clear
  recovery, and NONE bands, which indicate no predicted alert.

* The alerting and guidance logics are configurable through a new class
  called AlertLevels. This class includes a list of AlertThresolds and is
  ordered by alert level from less severe to more severe. Alert levels
  are 1-indexed. Alerting logic returns level of most severe set of
  alert thresholds that are violated, where level 0 indicates absence of alert.

* Configuration parameters, including alerting levels, can be read
  from a file. 

* Getting and setting of configuration parameters has also
  changed. Instead of providing setters and getters in the Daidalus
  and KinematicBandsParameters, these methods are provided through
  the public field parameters in the Daidalus and DefaultValues in 
  KinematicBandsParameters. For instance, the previous call 
  daa.getHorizontalAcceleration() is now available through 
  daa.parameters.getHorizontalAcceleration().
  Similarly, the previous call 
  DefaultDaidalusParameters.getHorizontalAcceleration()
  is now available through
  KinematicBandsParameters.DefaultValues.getHorizontalAcceleration().

* The constant VERSION is now defined in KinematicBandsParameters, e.g.,
   the call Daidalus.VERSION needs to be
   KinematicBandsParameters.VERSION. There is also a function
   Daidalus.release().

Release DAIDALUS 0.99b, February 10, 2016  
---------------------
* Added interface function for computing contours
* Added interface functions for computing last time to maneuver

Center on March 26-27, 2015.

Release DAIDALUS 0.a, March 17, 2015
---------------------
Initial release of DAIDALUS interface. References to Chorus and
Stratway+ objects have been removed. DAIDALUS only depends on Util and
ACCoRD.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.4, February, 2015
--------------------------------
* Decoupled lookahead time and alert time. This adds a new parameter for
alert time. It also adds the ability to specify a base configuration
file.

* Improved stability of well-clear bands by adding a time
stabilization parameter.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3b, January, 2015
-------------------------------
Added interface methods for setting independent lookahead times for
conflict and well-clear bands.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3a, January, 2015
-------------------------------
Added conflict detection logic to be used in conjunction with
prevention bands logic in PT5 experiment.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3, January, 2015
-------------------------------
* Added alerting logic and altitude bands interface to be used in PT5 experiment.

* Redesigned core architectural components of Stratway to support
integration of Well-Clear algorithms in the Appendix of RTCA SC 228
Detection and Avoid.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's well-clear alerting
concept.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's altitude bands concept.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's well-clear recovery bands. Current
implementation supports strategies for selecting most urgent aircraft
based on DCPA and Time to Closest Point of Apporach (TCPA).

Release Stratway+ 1.8.4a, July, 2013
-------------------------------
* Modified interface to the TCAS prevention bands computed by Stratway+ to
enable different time and distance threshold tables for different aircraft.
* Initiated the development of prevention bands for flight levels. These
kinds of prevention bands indicate flight levels that are predicted to
be in conflict or cause a TCAS alert. In addition to aircraft state of
information (position and velocity vector information), the computation of
these bands require vertical acceleration and target rate of climb for the
ownship.

Release Stratway+ 1.8.3, April, 2013
-------------------------------
* Added table of time and distance thresholds for TCAS II Traffic
Alerts (TA).
* Added configurable TCAS II DMOD, TAU, ZTHR, and HMD threshold 
parameters.
* Added configurable on/off HMD filter for the TCAS II RA detection
logic.
* Added methods to access distance-based and TCAS-based conflict
information including most urgent conflict and for every conflict:
time to conflict, time out of conflict, and time of closest approach
(or time of minimum tau depending of configuration parameters).

February 21, 2013
--------------
Implemented a new interface to the TCAS-II RA detection code in
Stratway. The new interface will enable more sophisticated aircraft
kinematic models for predicting RAs and computing RA prevention bands.

December 5 2012
--------------
Developed a software interface in Stratway to support Langley's SSA
concept of integration. The software interface provides the following
functionality: creation of Stratway objects for onwnship and traffic
aircraft, setting of configurable parameters such as time delays,
lookahead times, and maximum aircraft performance values, checking if
an aircraft is well-clear for TCAS-II RAs, and computing kinematics
prevention bands for conflict-free areas in the airspace.
